This is a fork of django-tagging!

(http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/
 or
http://github.com/clones/django-tagging)

THE MAIN AND CURRENTLY ONLY DIFFERENCE TO THE ORIGIN BRANCH IS THAT
THERE IS A SETTINGS OPTION CALLED

FORCE_COMMA_SEPARATOR

IF ITS TRUE; django-tagging USES COMMA AS SEPARATOR ALWAYS!
I NEED THIS FOR django-tagging-autocomplete!
